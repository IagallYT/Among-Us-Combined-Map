How to download?
You can download the .rar file from github releases in the version that you want.
No need use steam! And it's free!!!

Why you should you download?
Because it was a very big map that contains many rooms and tasks from all 4 maps in Among Us.
And it's very fun when play hidenseek with your friend that loaded this!

Why need to be Town of Impostor?
Because there is the agent role (which you can always access camms and admin table)
and the operative role (that can place down gadgets that allow them to track the impostor)
