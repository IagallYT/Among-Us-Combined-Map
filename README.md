Among Us Combined Map

This is an BepInEx mod that replaces the polus map with a new map called custom impostor.
This new map is the cobination of many rooms from all 4 maps from Among Us!

How to download?
Requirements:
- Among Us from Steam
- (If you don't want to buy Among Us!, you can get free Among Us from my Youtube channel which I will upload free Among Us links from steam there)
My Youtube Channel: youtube.com/Iamgoodatlifelol

You need to download the .rar file from github releases that matches to your Among Us version.
If the version doesn't match, the mod won't work.

Why you should download?
Because it was a very big map that contains many rooms and tasks from all 4 maps in Among Us.
And it's very fun when play hidenseek with your friend that loaded this!
