This is a BepInEx mod that replaces the Polus map with a new map called Custom Impostor.

## How to download

Requirements:
- Among Us from Steam
- Or you can just download free Among Us from [my YouTube channel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCFZlRTzu_9BWQNw74NwZ6Lw) (I will upload free Among Us there)

You need to download the .zip file from github releases that matches to your Among Us version.
If the version doesn't match, the mod won't work.

### Steps:
1. Download the file from releases that match to your Among Us version
2. Move the zip file to the folder that contains Among Us.exe
3. Unzip the file you've download
4. Launch Among Us!

Your Among Us should looks like this before launching!
