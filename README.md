# Among Us Combined Map

This is a BepInEx mod that replaces the Polus map with a new map called Custom Impostor.
This new map is the cobination of many rooms from all 4 maps from Among Us!

**Every player in the room must have the mod installed for it to work correctly. Please DO NOT play Polus Map on public lobbies.**

# Installation 

## How to download

**Requirements:**
- Among Us from Steam
- Or you can just download free Among Us from [my YouTube channel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCFZlRTzu_9BWQNw74NwZ6Lw) (I will upload free Among Us there)

**You need to download the .zip file from github releases that matches to your Among Us version.
If the version doesn't match, the mod won't work.**

### Steps:
1. Download the file from [releases](https://github.com/IagallYT/Among-Us-Combined-Map/releases) that match to your Among Us version
2. Make a new folder in desktop and named whatever you want.
3. Copy all files from your Among Us folder to the folder that you've created.
4. Copy the zip file that you have downloaded and paste to that new folder.
5. Unzip the zipped file.
6. Then you can now delete the zipped file.
7. Launch Among Us!

Your Among Us should looks like this before launching!

## Uninstalling the mod
If you want to uninstall the mod and make it become a normal Among Us game, delete these files.
- `BepInEx folder`
- `mono folder`
- `doorstop_config.ini`
- `winhttp.dll`

# Troubleshooting

## Known Errors

1. The mod hasn't come yet eventhough you unzipped the file already. (If the mod works, there will be the word LevelImposter in the first page)
- Wait a little bit and then launch Among Us again.
- If you wait for more than 5 minutes already but the mod doesn't come yet. Check if you do everything correctly in steps by steps. **Check the version carefully (every number and letters must match to your Among Us version)**.
- Check if there are 4 new files.
  - `BepInEx folder`
  - `mono folder`
  - `doorstop_config.ini`
  - `winhttp.dll`
- If the mod still doesn't come yet, contact me on [discord](https://discord.gg/bucGrNRuCF)
