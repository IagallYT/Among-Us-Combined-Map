This is a BepInEx mod that replaces the Polus map with a new map called Custom Impostor.
This new map is the cobination of many rooms from all 4 maps from Among Us!

How to download?

Requirements:
- Among Us from Steam
- (If you don't want to buy Among Us!, you can get free Among Us from my Youtube channel which I will upload free Among Us links from steam that works)

You need to download the .zip file from github releases that matches to your Among Us version.
If the version doesn't match, the mod won't work.

1. Download the file from releases that match to your Among Us version
2. Move the zip file to the folder that contains Among Us.exe
3. Unzip the file you've download
4. Launch Among Us!

Your Among Us should looks like this before launching!
