**How to download?
Requirements:
- Among Us from Steam
- (If you don't want to buy Among Us!, you can get free Among Us from my Youtube channel which I will upload free Among Us links from steam there)
My Youtube Channel: youtube.com/Iamgoodatlifelol
You need to download the .rar file from github releases that matches to your Among Us version.
**If the version doesn't match, it won't work.

**Why you should you download?

Because it was a very big map that contains many rooms and tasks from all 4 maps in Among Us.
And it's very fun when play hidenseek with your friend that loaded this!

Why need to be Town of Impostor?
Because there is the agent role (which you can always access camms and admin table)
and the operative role (that can place down gadgets that allow them to track the impostor)
